# Tailwind CSS @apply Directive Unexpected Behavior
This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive.  The issue arises from potential conflicts or missing utility classes referenced within the `@apply` directive. This can lead to unexpected styling or rendering issues.

## Bug Description
When using the `@apply` directive to apply a set of utility classes, if one or more of the referenced classes are missing or there are conflicting class names, the expected styling may not be applied correctly. This often results in unexpected visual output.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open `bug.js` (or equivalent file) to see the problematic code using the `@apply` directive.
4. Observe the unexpected styling in the rendered output.
5. Compare the results with the solution provided in `bugSolution.js`.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring that all utility classes referenced within `@apply` are correctly defined in your Tailwind configuration and that there are no naming conflicts.  Properly managing your Tailwind configuration and class names is crucial to avoid such issues.
